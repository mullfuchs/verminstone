	/*
	 * NPC systems
	 * need a way to make different profiles so what do npcs do?
	 * Health: they got a lot or a little 
	 * Defense: how hardy they are to hits 
	 * Attack: how much they attack 
	 * Endurance: how much they keep stamina
	 * Stamina Amount: How long can they go
	 * can I think of more?
	 * Recovery: how fast they recover Stamina
	 * Bravery: do they stay on task under duress?
	 * Run speed: how fast they run
	 * 
	 * where is this defined? maybe in scripts? so do I parse the json script?
	 * do I make a separate class that holds all these things?
	 * yeah and make it serializable so I can just throw it into a fucking save file
	 * 
	 * csv that's loaded at start?
	 * 
	 * these stats are also going to have to be saved and restored on load too
