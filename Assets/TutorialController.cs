	 * probably wanna do a elevator animation first
	 * then trigger a dialog.
	 * then have an event triggered by certain things, like vstone collected or enemies killed?
	 * going to have a start and end trigger
	 * start trigger: going into a volume
	 * end trigger, vstone fragments are all collected
	 * Triggers have an on trigger event
	 * theres an on trigger stay event? or it has a count every frame after the npc enters it and it checks if the
	 * vstone is still there
	 * fragments are there
	 * if both are gone then it triggers the "ending"
