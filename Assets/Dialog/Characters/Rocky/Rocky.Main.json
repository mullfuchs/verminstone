Yeah it's fucking weird, but there's a real good reason\nIf you take those teeth, and you grind em up real good\nthen you apply some heat, let it sit for a bit\nand then you take the little crystals that form, and smoke that shit\nIt goes by a lot of names but we just call it Fang\nThis being an isolated slave labor mine and refinery, like, who wouldn't be getting ripped all the time?\nFang's great, try it some time if you really want to.\nBut really, if you bring up some bug teeth, I can get you all some stuff.\nI can get you just about anything, I have access to the managment bunks\nAll for bug teeth, don't try to make Fang yourself, I mean you can try\nAlso considering the life expectancy of folks that work the Verminstone shafts, well. shit I'd probably be high as fuck too\nI've yammered on pretty much long enough, but listen.
